***WORD OF ADVICE: Always "git pull" BEFORE you "git push"***

Procedure for pushing a change from your local repository to the
remote origin repository:

	git pull
	git add [FILE NAMES]
	git commit -m [COMMIT MESSAGE]
	git push origin [NAME OF BRANCH]



To create a local clone of a GitHub repository:

	git clone https://github.com/georgyzakharov/ProjCompetition1.git

To list all branches in your local repository:

	git branch -a

To switch to a branch you want to work in:

	git checkout [NAME OF BRANCH]

To confirm you are working in the branch that you think you are:

	git branch

To update your local repository:

	git pull

To commit your changes to the working branch:

	git add [NAMES OF FILES THAT WERE ADDED/CHANGED]
		Alternatively, you can add the entire
		directory where the files are located
		(e.g., "git add [NAME OF DIRECTORY]")

	git commit -m "[WRITE COMMIT MESSAGE HERE]"

	git push origin [NAME OF BRANCH TO PUSH TO]

Location of global Git config file:

	~/.gitconfig

Edit your identity for Git (your username and email):

	git config --global user.name "[USERNAME]"

	git config --global user.email [EMAIL]
		No quotes above!

Edit your preferred text editor when using Git (Linux/macOS):

	git config --global core.editor [EDITOR NAME]

Edit your preferred text editor when using Git (Windows):

	On a Windows system, if you want to use a different text editor, you must specify
	the full path to its executable file. This can be different depending on how your
	editor is packaged.

	In the case of Notepad++, a popular programming editor, you are likely to want to
	use the 32-bit version, since at the time of writing the 64-bit version doesn’t
	support all plug-ins. If you are on a 32-bit Windows system, or you have a 64-bit
	editor on a 64-bit system, you’ll type something like this:

		$ git config --global core.editor "'C:/Program Files/Notepad++/notepad++.exe'
		multiInst -nosession"

	If you have a 32-bit editor on a 64-bit system, the program will be installed in
	C:\Program Files (x86):

		$ git config --global core.editor "'C:/Program Files (x86)/Notepad++
		notepad++.exe' -multiInst -nosession"

Check your current Git settings:

	git config --list

Delete a local repository:

	On Linux/macOS systems, simply delete the directory:

		rm -r [NAME OF LOCAL REPOSITORY]

	On Windows systems:

		Launch File Explorer, locate the folder, delete it

Check on the status of a branch:

	git status

Tracking files in a branch:

	git add [NAME OF FILES]
		The above line starts tracking for the provided
		files in a branch

Stop tracking files in a branch:

	git rm --cached [FILE NAMES]
		Note: if you have also committed a file but have
		not yet pushed it, you will need to add the "-f"
		option to force Git to stop tracking the file

Staging vs. Commits:

	The files that Git tracks are automatically added to the
	"staging area" (are staged) when they are modified, deleted,
	or added to the local repository. The staging area is a cache
	of change operations that Git stores in preparation of a write
	to the remote origin repository.

	Commits are changes that Git writes from the staging area to
	a remote origin repository.

To undo a commit and keep all files staged:

	git reset --soft HEAD~;
		In case you just want to undo the commit and change nothing more.
		This is most often used to make a few changes to your latest commit
		and/or fix your commit message. Leaves working tree as it was before
		"reset". "soft" does not touch the index file or the working tree at
		all (but resets the head to the previous commit). This leaves all your
		changed files as "Changes to be committed", as git status would put it.

To undo a commit and unstage all files:

	git reset HEAD~;
		In case you want to undo the last commit and unstage all the files.

or

	git reset --mixed HEAD~;
		"mixed" will reset the index but not the working tree (i.e., the
		changed files are preserved but not marked for commit) and reports
		what has not been updated. This is the default action.

To undo a commit and completely remove all changes:

	git reset --hard HEAD~;
		The following method will undo the commit and revert all changes
		so that your state is exactly as it was before you started making
		changes. "hard" resets the index and working tree. Any changes to
		tracked files in the working tree since the previous commit are
		discarded.

Rewrite a commit message:

	git -amend

Push/pull without a password:

	First, generate an SSH key (Linux/macOS only) via the command:

		ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "[YOUR GITHUB EMAIL ADDRESS]"
			Note: do NOT use a passphrase when this command
			prompts you for one, simply hit the <ENTER> key
			BOTH times that you are prompted to provide a
			passphrase.

	The above command will generate two keys, a public key (".pub" file
	extension) and a private key. They are stored by default in your
	"~/.ssh" directory, though this can vary depending on where you
	generate the keys in your filesystem. If they are not located in
	your "~/.ssh" directory, look in the directory where you executed 
	the "ssh-keygen" command for your pair of keys.

	The creator of the repository must go to the repository on GitHub.
	There will be a "Settings" option located to the far upper right of the
	repository (it appears a gear wheel). Click on this option.

	You will be directed to an administrative interface for the webpage.
	On the far left side of the page, look for the phrase "Deploy keys".
	Click on this option.
	
	On the resulting page that appears, click on "Add deploy key". Give a
	title to the key (use the filename for simplicity, e.g. "id_rsa.pub").
	Then paste the contents of the public key into the key field.

	Make sure to allow write access to the repository with the SSH key by
	selecting the "Allow write access" checkbox located beneath the key field.
	By default, a deployed SSH key for a repository only permits read access
	(i.e., the key user can only pull, not push to the repository).

	Click "Add key". Note that only keys which are not in use ANYWHERE else on
	GitHub can be used as deploy keys (i.e., users who have the same SSH keys for
	their profiles on GitHub cannot also use those keys as a repository deploy
	key).

	Try pushing. You should no longer need a password to do this.
